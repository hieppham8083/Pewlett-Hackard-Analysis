# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Build Employee Database with PostgreSQL to determine the number of retiring employees and their position titles, and the other to identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 

## Results
- The first table of retiring employees: [retirement_titles.csv](../main/Data/retirement_titles.csv)
- The second table of employee who are eligible for the mentorship program: [mentorship_eligibility.csv](../main/Data/mentorship_eligibility.csv)

## Summary
- This project assumed retirement years between 1952 and 1955.
- With these results table, the company can plan the mentorship program.
- Also we can use [QuickDBD](https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/#/) to demonstrates relationships between all tables as shown below:
